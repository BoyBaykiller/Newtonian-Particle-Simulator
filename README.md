# C# OpenGL Newtonian-Particle-Simulator

This is a very simplistic particle engine.
The whole pipeline consists out of a [single shader program](Newtonian-Particle-Simulator/res/shaders/particles).
The vertex shader computes and renders particles at the same time. The fragment shader just outputs the computed colors with blending enabled.
The actual particles are stored in a Shader Storage Buffer which is a really useful arbitrary read/write interface of global GPU memory.

Requires OpenGL 4.5.
